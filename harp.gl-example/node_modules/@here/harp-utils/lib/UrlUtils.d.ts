/**
 * Resolve URI of referenced object w.r.t parent URI.
 *
 * Resolves `childUri` as it would be loaded from location specified by `parentUri`.
 *
 * If `childUri` is absolute, then it is returned unchanged.
 * If `childUri` is origin-absolute path, then only origin path is taken from `parentUri`.
 *
 * See [[baseUri]] for reference how base URL of `parentUri` is determined.
 *
 * Supports `http:`, `https:`, `file:`, `data:` schemes.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *     // normal case, child is sibling
 *     https://foo.com/themes/day.json + images/foo.png -> https://foo.com/themes/images/foo.png
 *
 *     // parent is "folder", so child is just located in this folder
 *     https://foo.com/themes/ + images/foo.png -> https://foo.com/themes/images/foo.png
 *
 *     // parent looks like leaf, so last component is stripped
 *     https://foo.com/themes + images/foo.png -> https://foo.com/images/foo.png
 *
 *     // origin-absolute URL, takes only origin from parent
 *     https://foo.com/themes/day.json + /fonts/foo.json -> https://foo.com/fonts/foo.json
 *
 * @param parentUri - URI of parent resource
 * @param childUri - URI of child as referenced from parent resource
 * @return `childUrl` as if anchored in location of `parentUrl`
