/**
 * Class computing horizon tangent points and intersections with canvas for spherical projection.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * The horizon for a sphere is a circle formed by all intersections of tangent lines passing through
 * the camera with said sphere. It lies on a plane perpendicular to the sphere normal at the camera
 * and it's center is at the line segment joining the sphere center and the camera.
 *
 * The further the camera is, the nearer the horizon center gets to the sphere center, only reaching
 * the sphere center when the camera is at infinity. In other words, the horizon observed from a
 * finite distance is always smaller than a great circle (a circle with the sphere radius, dividing
 * the sphere in two hemispheres, and therefore it's radius is smaller than the sphere's.
